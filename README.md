# VQP-Net

1. Resnet_distortion_classification_and_ranking for pretraining with augmented data

## Transfer learning:
1. First run Resnet_frame_level_score.py to generate frame level scores
2. Then run video_score_fcnn.py to get video scores

## End-to-end learning:

Run end_to_end_VQPnet.py. Other configurations besides FCNN can also be run by 
uncommenting specific parts of code. Other configurations include LSTM, RNN and GRU.
